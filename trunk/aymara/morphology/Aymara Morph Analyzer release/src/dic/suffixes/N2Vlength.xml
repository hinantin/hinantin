<comment> the other verbalizer is in N2Vka; see also N2Vcha, which
is a bit of a guess by me </comment>

<comment> it appears (25 July 2000) that this ^L verbalizer has
an allomorph ya that is used when the following suffix, e.g. [1-3_Future]
consists of or begins with ^L.  Thus the sequence ^L ^L on the lower
side of aymara-lex.fst would appear to be phonologically impossible,
requiring that the first ^L be changed to ya

	<comment> usually N2V by lengthening, unless the following suffix
		consists of or begins with lenthening; in that case, the
		phonologically triggered allophone is ya; see the rules
