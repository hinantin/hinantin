1. WHAT?  
"Let's Speak Quechua: The Implementation of a Text-to-Speech System for the Incas' Language"

The cus_quz_gui_hts package consists of a library providing
analysis of Southern Quechua text, and the data to extend  
Festival so that it can speak Southern Quechua.

THE MATERIAL PRESENTED HERE BELONGS TO THE THESIS PROJECT SUSCRIBED   
ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS AT UNSAAC BY THE AUTHORS, WITH THE      
RESOLUTION NUMBER D-1134-2011-FCQFM ON THE 21TH OF DECEMBER 2011      

www.unsaac.edu.pe

Basically, there are two components:

(1) Linguistic data and code to extend Festival for Quechua.
    Tokenizer, lts rules, POStagger data, etc.

    This includes one folder:
    cus_quz_gui_hts (basically code)

(2) Voices: speaker dependent data. 
    There is one folder for each voice
    voices/quz/cus_quz_'speaker-name'

2. WHO?

Most of the code and data has been specifically developed for the thesis
project suscribed  according to the requirements at UNSAAC by the authors,
with the resolution number D-1134-2011-FCQFM on the 21st of Dedember

www.unsaac.edu.pe

The lexicon has been enriched in the following way:
 - Phonetic transcriptions have been manually generated using PRAAT

3. TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   All the code and linguistic resources are provided under the 
   LGPL license (see the COPYING file).


4. REQUERIMENTS
   You need a working Festival system.
   Check in your Linux distribution or in the Festival home page
   http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/

   We have been working with version 2.1, November 2010
   (Execute $ festival --version )

5. INSTALLATION

   We have developed two quechuan voices.
   All of them share a common library, which is language
   related. Therefore, you need the 'base' package plus
   the specific voices you are interested in.

   You just need to copy several folder in the datadir of Festival.
   To find this directory, you can execute
   $ festival -b '(print datadir)'

   * COMMON PACKAGE *
   Move the provided files to the festival 'datadir':

   a) Catalan tokenizer, tagger, etc. 
      Copy the folder lib/upc_catalan in 'datadir'/upc_catalan

   b) If you want that Festival understand the --language 
      option and exports the catalan speakers to other applications, 
      you need to update the languages.scm file to add Quechua. 
      We provide this file:
         lib/languages.scm => 'datadir'/languages.scm

   * VOICE SPECIFIC PACKAGES *

   c) Copy each quechuan voice, ex: cus_quz_gui_hts, in the voices
      directory. Example:
      lib/voices/quz/cus_quz_gui_hts => 'datadir'/voices/quz/cus_quz_gui_hts

6. EXECUTION

   There are several front-ends to be used with Festival, as 
   gnopernicus, or emacs-speak ... Here we only mention the direct use of
   Festival.

   WARNING WARNING WARNING !!!
     Festival expects latin-1 encoding. Be sure that you use
     this encoding in your terminal or files. If your system uses UFT8 (as
     do many distributions today) you need to convert the file before reading.
     Some front-ends, as gnopernicus, do the conversions for you.

     You can use the "save as" options in gedit; or use programs to convert the 
     format, as iconv:
     $ iconv -f utf8 -t latin1 myfile_utf8.text > myfile_latin1.text

   !!!


   * A quick test:
     $ echo "Imaynalla, Wayqeypanaykuna!" | festival --tts --language cuscoquechua

   * You can also execute Festival in interactive way:
     $festival
     (cus_quz_gui_hts)
     (SayText "Imaynalla, Wayqeypanaykuna!")
     (quit)

   * Use the text2wave script to create a .wav file:
     $ text2wave -o imaynalla.wav   -eval '(language_cusco_quechua)' imaynalla.txt 

     If you want to specify the speaker:
     $ text2wave -o imaynalla.wav   -eval '(voice_cus_quz_gui_hts)' imaynalla.txt
