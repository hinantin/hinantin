	<comment> leave the lexical side empty as shown; the lexical side tag
		is created from the gloss below; on the surface of the lexicon
		fst, the ^Z marks the presence of the zero complement--I use this
                as a way to study what can come just before the comp. cero--then
                probably just get rid of it by trivial initial rule
