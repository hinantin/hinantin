	<comment> If this +si is present in a word, then it
must be followed (perhaps at a slight distance) by a "ka adelantador"
see HVY:111 (having the progressive reading) </comment>

<comment> HVY says in text that this si cannot co-occur with following xa,
but in a footnote p. 121 this is contradicted by later work by Briggs;
for now, keep the analysis such that this si requires a subsequent
ka, but don't rule out a following xa;  eventually get clarification
when the Briggs book arrives </comment>

		<comment> remember that the continuative +si is here--this
		might be used to select the right -ka reading in v13 if 
		this ka is split into multiple readings </comment>

		<comment> check this against HVY:111 carefully </comment>

		<comment> after this +si morpheme, you need a
		following -ka with the progressive reading;
		possibly with slight separation; N.B. the -ka does
		not necessarily need a preceding si </comment>
